# NoteMaps Project

This project provides a way to develop a Google Maps application using React Native. It is designed to provide basic knowledge on how to use Google Maps API and provide user interaction on the map.

## Project Purpose

- Provide user interaction on the map **with Google Maps API**.
- Practice developing a map application with **React Native**.
- Learn to use different map types (standard, satellite, hybrid, etc.).
- Create an interactive experience on the map using the **Marker** and **Callout** components.
- Perform navigation, marking and data addition operations on the map using the **MapView** component.

## Features

- The user can add new markers on the map.
- The map type can be dynamically changed by the user (standard, satellite, hybrid, etc.).
- When clicking on the markers, a special callout is displayed.
- The user can drag the markers on the map.
- Shapes such as **Polyline** and **Polygon** can be created on the map.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: Used for mobile app development.
- **react-native-maps**: Used for Google Maps integration.

## Project Structure

- **MapExample**: Contains the map component and marker adding functionality.
- **CustomMarker**: Customizes our own marker component.
- **CustomCallout**: Contains a custom callout bubble for clickable markers on the map.
